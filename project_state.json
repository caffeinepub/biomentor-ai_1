Use the browser's Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition) to capture the student's voice input and convert it to text, pass that text to the existing bioAI client-side tutor logic to generate a biology response, and use the browser's Web Speech Synthesis API (speechSynthesis) to read the AI response aloud.
